Automating Identity Document Validation and Verification Using Computer Vision

Abstract:- The research paper presents apractical solution for identity document validation and verification that can be applied to various types of documents, including driving licenses, passports, and IDs from different countries. The proposed system aims to overcome the challenges of real-life identity document validation and verification by taking into account the unique features of each type of document. 

The paper outlines three main contributions: 
document detection, document validation, and verification.

To test the proposed solution, the researchers have used their institute's Student Identity Card as a case study. By implementing the proposed system, the researchers were able to validate and verify the selected documents accurately. The proposed solution can have significant implications for various industries that rely on document validation and verification, such as banking, insurance, and government


I. INTRODUCTION The process of identity document validation and verification is a critical aspect of various industries, such as banking, insurance, and government. It involves verifying the authenticity and accuracy of the information provided in a document, such as a passport, driving license, or identification card. Manual document verification processes can be time-consuming, expensive, and prone to errors. As a result, there is a need for
automated systems that can effectively and efficiently validate and verify documents.

This research paper proposes a practical solution for document validation and verification using computer vision
techniques. The goal of this system is to design a complete solution that takes into account the challenges of real-life identity document validation and verification and can be easily adapted to different types of documents from various countries. The proposed system's contributions are threshold: document detection, document
validation and verification. The paper presents insights gained from implementing pure computer vision
techniques for document detection and preprocessing images from real-life scenarios.
The proposed system is evaluated on a case study using the researcher's institute's Student Identity Cards. The proposed solution can have significant implications for various industries, helping to reduce the time and cost associated with manual document verification processes while improving accuracy and reducing errors.


FUTURE SCOPE AND CONCLUSION


In this research, we were successfully able to implement our proposed solution for Automation of Identity Document
Validation and Verification. During our manual testing of the system, we were able to generate an accuracy of almost
92%. The accuracy of system will increase when the model is trained on a larger dataset with more number of Identity
documents accepted. However, we were successful in providing a structural flow which helps in document validation and
verification using computer vision. In future, we would work further in order to extract the text from the documents and then validate, verify it. We also plan to incorporate a lot more documents in the system which will help to create a robust system  that validates and verifies the documents through-out. An further addition to the system can be done which will only allow the user to capture the image rather than uploading. This will prevent users from engaging in fraudulent activities.
